# Week 01

In this class, the induction principle, well-ordering principle, and
strong induction principles were covered. On top of this, a couple of 
theorems were proved using these principles, and Euler's Totient function 
was introduced.

## Induction Principle
Let $S \subset \mathbb N$ such that 

1. $0 \in S$
2. If $n \in S \Rightarrow n + 1 \in S$

Then $S = \mathbb N$

## Well Ordering Principle
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb N$ has a least element.

## Strong Induction Principle
Let $S \subset \mathbb N$ such that

1. $0 \in S$
2. if $\lbrace 0, 1 \dots n \rbrace \in S \Rightarrow n + 1 \in S$

Then $S = \mathbb N$

## *Proof* Induction $\Rightarrow$ Strong Induction
Assume that we have $S \subset \mathbb N$ s.t.

1. $0 \in S$
2. $\lbrace 0, \dots, n \rbrace \in S \Rightarrow n + 1 \in S$

And we need to show that $S = \mathbb N$ using only the induction principle.

Let $P(n)$ be the proposition $\rbrace 0, \dots, n\rbrace \subseteq S$.
$P(0)$ true because $0\in S$. Assume now that $P(k)$ true. This implies that
$\lbrace 0, \dots, k\rbrace \subset S \Rightarrow k+1 \in S$ This implies
that $\lbrace 0, \dots, k, k+1\rbrace \subset S$

We have thus proved that $P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1) \Rightarrow$
by induction principle, $P(n)$ true $\forall n \in \mathbb N$
$\Rightarrow \lbrace 0, \dots, n \rbrace \in S \forall n \in \mathbb B$
$\Rightarrow S = \mathbb N$

### Summary of Proof
Basically we assume that properties 1 and 2 of strong induction principle
hold, and show that $P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$ which implies that
$S = \mathbb N$ by the regular induction principle.

## *Proof* $WOP \Rightarrow$ Induction
We prove this using the *"minimal criminal"* or *"minimal counterexample"*
method.

Suppose $S \subset \mathbb N$ suh that $0 \in S$ and
$n \in S \Rightarrow n + 1 \in S$. *(Properties of induction)*. We show
that $S = \mathbb N$ using the well-ordering principle.

Let $S' = \mathbb N \setminus S$ and suppose that $S' \neq \emptyset$.
Then by the well ording principle, $\exists k \in S'$ a least element.
$0 \notin S'$ because $0 \in S \Rightarrow k = m + 1$ for some
$m \in \mathbb N$ and $m \notin S' \Rightarrow m \in S$.

But $m \in S \Rightarrow m + 1 \in S \Rightarrow k = m + 1 \in S$ and
$k = m + 1 \in S'$. But $S \cap S' = \emptyset \Rightarrow$ contradiction.
Therefore $S' = \emptyset \Rightarrow S = \mathbb n$

### Summary of Proof
We basically assume properties 1 and 2 of induction principle, then 
assume that the complement set $S'$ is non-empty, and assume it has a least
element $k \notin S$. However this leads to a contradiction, thus
$S = \mathbb N$

## *Theorem* Every natural number $n > 1$ has a prime divisor
We suppose that $S \neq \emptyset$ is the set of numbers that $>1$ that have
no prime divisor. This set must have a least element $k$ by the well
ording principle. $k$ cannot be prime because $k|k$
implying that $k$ is its own prime divisor. Thus $k$ must be composite.

This now implies that $k = a \cdot b$ for some $1 < a, b < k$. Since
$k$ is the least element of $S \Rightarrow a, b \notin S$. Therefore they
both have prime divisors $\Rightarrow a = p\cdot t$ for prime $p$. Thus
$k = p \cdot t \cdot b \Rightarrow k$ has a prime divisor. 
**Contradiction.** $\Rightarrow S = \emptyset$

## Euclidean Division
Let $n \in \mathbb Z$ and $d \in \mathbb Z ^+$. There exist two integers
$q, r \in \mathbb Z$ such that $n = qd +r$ and $r \in [0, d[$

## Euler's Totient Function
For any $n \in \mathbb Z^+$, $\varphi(n) =$ number of positive integers
smaller than $n$ such that $gcd(n, k) = 1$

# Week 02

## RSA

1. Choose two large distinct primes $p, q$
2. Let $m = pq \Rightarrow \varphi(m) = (p-1)(q-1)$
3. Choose $e \leq m - 1$ such that $gcd(e, \varphi(m)) = 1$
4. Use Euclidean method to find $d \leq m-1$ such that
$ed - k\varphi(m) = 1$ for a $k \in \mathbb Z$
5. Public encoding key $(m, e)$, keep decoding key $(m, d)$

This works because:

$$
x^{ed} (mod m) \equiv x (mod m) 
\forall x \in \lbrace 0, 1, \dots, m-1 \rbrace
$$

this holds thanks to *Fermat's little theorem*

## Groups
A group is a set $G$ sich a binary operation 
$\cdot: G \times G \rightarrow G$ satisfying

 satisfying

1. Associativity
2. $\exists$ a neural element $\mathbb 1 \in G$
3. For any $a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G$

$G$ is called **finite** if $|G| < \infty$, then $|G|$ is the order of the 
group.

$G$ is called **abelian** if $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in G$

## Subgroups

$H \subset G$ is a **subgroup** if $H$ is a subet in $G$ such that
$\mathbb 1 \in H$ and $H$ is closed w.r.t $\cdot$ and taking inverses.

### Remark
Any group $G$ has a subgroup generated by one element $g \in G$. 
consider $\lbrace 1, g, g^2, \dots, g^{-1}, g^{-2}\lbrace$ =
$\langle g \rangle$. Then $\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup by 
construction.

## Order
If there exists $n \in \mathbb N^+$ minimal s.t. $g^n = \mathbb 1_G$, then
$n$ is called the order of $g$. In a finite group, each element has finite
order.

## Cosets
Let $H \subset G$ a subgroup, with $g \in G$. The **left coset** $gH$ is
the set o group elements of the form $gH = \lbrace gh, h \in H$

We have the following properties

1. Two left cosets $xH$ and $yH$ are either $xH = yH$ or 
$xH \cap yH = \emptyset$
2. $\forall g \in G$ belongs to a left $H$-coset.
3. $|xH| = |H|$ for any $x \in G$

### Proof sketches
1. We can show that $xH \subset yH$ and $yH \subset xH$ if their intersection
is nonempty. Therefore they are either empty or equal.
2. Since $gH = \lbrace g 1, gh_1, \dots \rbrace$ and $g\cdot1 = g$ we see
that every $g$ belongs to a left $H$-coset.
3. $f: H \rightarrow xH$ is a bijection, and thus $|xH| = |H|$

## *Theorem* Lagrange
If $G$ is a finite group, and $H \subset G$ is a subgroup, then
$|H|$ divides $|G|$

***Proof on page 9 lecture 2***

## *definition* Index
The number of $H$-cosets in $G$ is called the index of $H$ in $G$. It is 
written $[G: H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}$

### Corollary
1. Let $g \in G$ be a finite group. Then the order of $g$ divides $|G|$
2. $g^{|G|} = \mathbb 1$

***Proofs on page 10 lecture 2***

## Euler's Theorem
Let $a, n \in \mathbb Z ^+$ such that $gcd(a, n) = 1$. Then

$$
a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 (mod\,n)
$$

## Fermat's Little Theorem
Let $a \in \mathbb Z ^+$, $p$ a prime such that $p$ does not divide $a$.
Then

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 (mod\,p)
$$

# Week 03

## Group Homomorphisms
A map $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ between two groups is a group homomorphism
if $\varphi (x \cdot_G y) = \varphi(x) \cdot_H \varphi(y)$.

This implies that $\varphi(\mathbb 1_G) = \mathbb 1_H$ and that
$\varphi(x^{-1}) = (\varphi(x))^{-1}$. A group homomorphism that is invertible
is called a group ***isomorphism***. We say that two groups are isomorphic.

## Generators of a group
Generators of a group $G$ is a minimal set of elements of $G$ such that any
element of $G$ can be written as a product of generators and their inverses.

## Relations
Any equation satisfied by group elements is called a relation.

## Presentation
A presentation of $G$ in generators and relations is an expression
$\langle S | R \rangle where $S$ is a set of generators and $R$ is a minimal
set of relations for the generators in $S$ such that any other relation in
$G$ follows from these.

# Week 04

## Kernel of a Homomorphism
The kernel of a homomorphmism $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ is the set of elements
$g\in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \mathbb 1_H$

### *proposition*
Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be a group homomorphism. Then 
$ker\, \varphi \subset G$ is a subgroup. is a subgroup.

We prove this by showing that properties of subgroup hold for arbitrary elements
from the kernel.

## Normal Subgroup
$H \subset G$ is a normal subgroup if $\forall h \in H, \forall g \in G$ we
have $g h g^{-1} \in H$. We write $H \triangleleft G$.

If $\varphi$ is a group homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, then
$ker\,\varphi \triangleleft G$ is a normal subgroup.
